      <p> You'll find a selection of current deals from our member resorts on RENT-A-RESORT DEALS.
        In order to be qualified as a deal, the offer needs to be below regular prices for exclusive rentals of resorts.
        In most cases, the opportunity results from season extentions or
        from slots during the season when suppliers will find it hard to achieve a satisfactory occupation rate.
        This is how RENT-A-RESORT works for all requests thanks to a database of opportunities on hand which helps us to compare dates/prices and deliver a quote on time.
        Only a selection of those opportunities is published on RENT-A-RESORT Deals. </p>
